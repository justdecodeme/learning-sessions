1. 1) HTML and CSS is for User Interface.
   2) Javascript is for Logic.

2. Html 
   1) <body>

   - Semantics
   - Structure(eg: bone) - Indentation.
     For step by step structure:
	Front-End: four spaces
	Back-End: two spaces
   - Accessibility - Accessible by the user.
      eg: <li> tag, rollon.

3. Introduction on ARIA which stands for Accessibility Rich Internet Application.

   1) ARIA has a set of attributes to help enhance the semantics of a web site or
      web application to help assistive technologies, 
      such as screen readers for the blind,
      make sense of certain things that are not native to HTML.

   2) Every website has a layout: 

	- HEADER
   - The top section consisting Logo is using <div>. 
   - Then the section consisting of Navigation is Global Navigation.
   - The section including Logo and the Navigation is header
   - Sometimes next to Logo you might find some button 
     which is known as CTA (call to action) and that section is Utility.
   - If you find the location finder then that is using the <address> tag.

	- MAIN
   - The next below section which consists of main visual is known as 
     Hero, Main Visual, Mast head. 
   - If it consists of any <h1> tag then, it indicates heading.

4. For navigation we use,
       
     1) <nav>
		<ul>
			<li>_</li>
		</ul>
	</nav>


     2) So in the <nav> tag we can add ARIA attribute,

        <nav role="navigation" aria-label="Global Navigation">

           - role : is used to specify the role of the tag (where it belongs).

           - aria-label : This attribute is case-insensitive. 
                        : You need to specify the full name as you speak.

5. A good development practice is when,

    1) class is used for css (eg: class="hero")
    2) Id is used for Javascript (eg: id="hero")


6. If we have a form say,

    1) <h2>Hobbies options</h2>
       <input type="radio"...>

    2) We can use,

      <h2 id="hobbyoptions">
      <input type="radio" aria-labelledby="hobbyoptions">

7. Naming concention for css: 
   
   - eg: login button

   1) class="TYPE_ROLE_MOD"
   2) class="button"
   3) class="button_login"
   4) class="button_login_small";
   5) id="lowerCamelCase"
